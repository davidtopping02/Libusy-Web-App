                The University of Dundee Library Occupancy Tracker (Libusy) is a progressive web application developed
                as part of David Topping's final BSc Hons Computing Science final year project. It is designed to
                address the challenge of finding a quiet study space in the university library, especially during peak
                times like exam periods. Using a combination of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and live data from
                turnstile gates, the application provides real-time occupancy information for library sections as well
                as predicting the occupancy levels of each section. This allows students to make informed decisions on
                when and where to study by avoiding crowded areas.
